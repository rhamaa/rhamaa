# Scalable REST API Backend with Django

This project showcases a production-ready REST API backend built with Django and Django REST Framework. The system is designed for scalability, security, and maintainability, serving as the backbone for web and mobile applications.

## Project Overview

### Core Features
- **RESTful API Design**: Clean, intuitive endpoints following REST principles
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based auth with role-based permissions
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries with PostgreSQL
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated with drf-spectacular
- **Containerization**: Docker setup for easy deployment

## Technical Stack

### Backend Framework
- **Django 4.x**: Robust web framework with excellent ORM
- **Django REST Framework**: Powerful toolkit for building Web APIs
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable relational database
- **Redis**: Caching and session management

### Key Libraries
- `djangorestframework-simplejwt`: JWT authentication
- `django-cors-headers`: CORS handling for frontend integration
- `django-filter`: Advanced filtering capabilities
- `celery`: Asynchronous task processing

## Architecture

### API Structure
```
/api/v1/
  ├── /auth/          # Authentication endpoints
  ├── /users/         # User management
  ├── /products/      # Product CRUD operations
  └── /orders/        # Order processing
```

### Database Design
- Normalized schema for data integrity
- Proper indexing for query optimization
- Foreign key relationships with cascading rules
- Migration management for version control

## Security Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. User login with credentials
2. Server validates and issues JWT tokens
3. Access token for API requests
4. Refresh token for obtaining new access tokens

### Security Measures
- Password hashing with Django's built-in PBKDF2
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- SQL injection prevention through ORM

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
```python
# Efficient query with select_related and prefetch_related
products = Product.objects.select_related('category')\
    .prefetch_related('images')\
    .filter(is_active=True)
```

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for session storage
- Query result caching for frequently accessed data
- Cache invalidation on data updates

### Pagination
Implemented cursor-based pagination for large datasets:
```python
class ProductPagination(CursorPagination):
    page_size = 20
    ordering = '-created_at'
```

## API Documentation

Auto-generated documentation using drf-spectacular:
- Interactive Swagger UI
- ReDoc interface
- OpenAPI 3.0 schema
- Code examples in multiple languages

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for models and serializers
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Test coverage > 85%

## Deployment

### Docker Setup
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["gunicorn", "config.wsgi:application"]
```

### Environment Configuration
- Separate settings for development/staging/production
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Database connection pooling
- Static file serving with WhiteNoise

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Version Control**: Git with meaningful commit messages
3. **Code Quality**: PEP 8 compliance, type hints
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and README
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful error responses with proper status codes

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: N+1 Query Problem
**Solution**: Used `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` to optimize database queries.

### Challenge 2: API Versioning
**Solution**: Implemented URL-based versioning for backward compatibility.

### Challenge 3: File Uploads
**Solution**: Integrated with cloud storage (AWS S3) for scalable file handling.

## Future Enhancements

- GraphQL endpoint for flexible data fetching
- WebSocket support for real-time features
- Advanced search with Elasticsearch
- Microservices architecture for specific modules
- API rate limiting per user tier

## Lessons Learned

- Importance of proper database indexing
- Value of comprehensive API documentation
- Benefits of containerization for deployment
- Need for robust error handling and logging
- Significance of security best practices

This project demonstrates the ability to build production-ready backend systems that are secure, scalable, and maintainable—essential skills for modern full-stack development.
