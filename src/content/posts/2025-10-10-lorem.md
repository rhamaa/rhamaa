# My Journey in IoT and Full-Stack Development

As an IoT Engineer and Full-Stack Developer, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects that bridge the gap between hardware and software. From developing temperature monitoring systems with AR integration to building mobile applications with Flutter, each experience has shaped my understanding of modern technology ecosystems.

## Key Learnings

### Hardware-Software Integration
Working with microcontrollers like ESP32 and Arduino taught me the importance of efficient resource management and real-time data processing. The challenges of embedded systems development have made me a better software engineer overall.

### Cloud-Based IoT Solutions
Integrating IoT devices with cloud platforms like Blynk and AWS has shown me the power of scalable architectures. Real-time data visualization and remote device management are game-changers for modern IoT applications.

### Full-Stack Development
My experience with Django and Python for backend development, combined with Flutter for mobile apps, has given me a holistic view of application architecture. Understanding both ends of the stack enables better design decisions.

## Looking Forward
I'm excited to continue exploring the intersection of IoT, AI (particularly Computer Vision with YOLO), and cloud computing. The future of connected devices is bright, and I'm eager to contribute to innovative solutions that make a real-world impact.
